# Go Go Gadgets

I keep hearing people rave about vibe-coding and how great AI is. Simultaneously, I'm in the process of restructuring my consulting business from a simple LLC to S-corp and wanted to create some models to understand the costs/savings between the two business structures. Like most great tools, I started building a spreadsheet and consulting Claude on some buggy formulas (tax brackets...ugh) when it randomly generated an interactive React component to model the formula for me. I thought it was kinda cool, and after fixing my formula in Numbers, I came back to Claude and asked it to model the entire spreadsheet. A few hours later, Go Go Gadgets was born...
